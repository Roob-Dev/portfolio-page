			<h2>A little about me</h2>
			<p>I'm currently learning the basics of front-end web development at Thinkful. I've studied programming in the past, with languages such as python, and c++.
			Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed learning new languages. I currently speak English, and Spanish fluently. I also speak Japanese and Korean but not as fluently... yet!
			I feel that this is the beginning of an exciting journey, and I hope you'll stay tuned for my future projects!
